# Lab 00 - Getting Set up for Exercises

In this first exercise we'll make sure that we're all set up with our AWS credentials and access to AWS.

## Log into the AWS Console

1. Log in to AWS using the link, username, and password provided to you
1. In the top bar, near the right, you'll see your username/alias @ tf-intro - clicking on that will display a dropdown
1. In the dropdown, click on "My Security Credentials"
1. This will take you to your security credentials screen/tab; feel free to change your password if you like; the account will remain active throughout class today

Having done that, we should be ready to move on!
